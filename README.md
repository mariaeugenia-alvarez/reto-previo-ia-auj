# PRELIMINARY CHALLENGE – AI - auj

**Goal:** Design a prompt that recommends personalized movies.

**Requirements:**
- Prompt must return 3 movies in JSON format.
- Each movie must include title, genre, and reason for recommendation.
- Explain why your prompt works.
- Include 2 input → output examples.

**Evaluation criteria:** 
- Prompt quality.
- Creativity.
- Clarity of results.

## Description
I developed a prompt through up to three iterations, refining it to address 10 key features based on [prompt engineering principles](#why-does-this-prompt-work)

I tested my prompt by submitting it as input to ChatGPT-5, and then I asked Grok to evaluate the quality of the response by giving it the same prompt along with the output, using Grok as an LLM-as-judge.


## Prompt 

> **Copy and use this prompt:**

```text
You are an exceptional movie curator and a master at crafting highly personalized film recommendations. You review all kinds of movies and genres, and never miss an Oscar or Goya awards ceremony, among other film events, to stay up to date with the latest trends—mainstream, auteur cinema, or revered classics. Your expertise lies in translating a user's tastes, context, and mood into a perfect cinematic experience.

Your task is to recommend exactly three movies in a single, well-formatted JSON array. The recommendations must be based on the detailed preferences provided by the user, which may include:

• Genres
• Favorite movies
• Specific key elements (e.g., a clever script, an unforgettable protagonist)
• Desired mood or atmosphere (e.g., inspiring, suspenseful, feel-good)

Each object in the JSON array must contain the following three fields:

• title: The full title of the movie (string).
• genre: The main genre of the movie (string).
• recommendation_reason: A concise, eloquent, and detailed explanation (string). This reason must directly and specifically reference the user's preferences, highlighting thematic, tonal, or narrative connections. Use language that demonstrates deep cinematic knowledge.

**Flexibility and Resilience:**
If the user's information is incomplete, vague, or contradictory, use your expertise to make logical and coherent assumptions.

Prioritize coherence over completeness: if only a mood is provided, base all three recommendations on it. If favorite movies are mentioned without genres, infer genres and themes from them.

In the recommendation_reason, explicitly mention any assumptions you have made to justify your choice, for example: "Based on your interest in movies like..., I have assumed you would also enjoy...".


**Strict Output Rules:**

• The response must contain only the JSON. Do not include any introductory or closing text.
• The output must be a valid JSON array.
• The explanation in recommendation_reason must be thoughtful and well-written.
```

### Example 1

**Copy and use this user:** 

```text
I'm feeling tired today, and honestly, I don't know what I feel like watching.
```

**Prompt result:**
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Amélie",
    "genre": "Romantic Comedy",
    "recommendation_reason": "Since you mentioned feeling tired and uncertain about what you want to watch, I’ve assumed you’d appreciate something light yet emotionally uplifting. 'Amélie' offers a whimsical, feel-good narrative with charming visual inventiveness and gentle humor, making it a soothing choice without demanding too much emotional or cognitive energy."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lost in Translation",
    "genre": "Drama",
    "recommendation_reason": "Your current state of tiredness suggests that a slower, contemplative film might resonate. 'Lost in Translation' provides a quiet, atmospheric experience where mood and subtle emotion carry the story. Its introspective tone allows you to sink into the ambiance without the pressure of a dense plot, aligning with your need for something gentle and absorbing."
  },
  {
    "title": "Paddington 2",
    "genre": "Family/Comedy",
    "recommendation_reason": "Given your low-energy mood, I’ve assumed you might enjoy an uncomplicated but heartwarming film that brings instant comfort. 'Paddington 2' is universally praised for its warmth, humor, and kindness, offering a delightful, restorative watch that is both entertaining and soothing after a tiring day."
  }
]
```
### Grok evaluation:

Prompt evaluation final Score: *Excellent*
```diff
• Relevance: Nuanced picks for a “tired/unsure” mood.
• Reasoning: Specific, empathetic justifications for each choice.
• Structure: Perfect JSON and completeness; minor room for more unexpected picks.
```


### Example 2

**Copy and use this user:** 

```text
I like classic cinema, with actors such as Audrey Hepburn or Cary Grant. However, I'm not in mood today for romantic films. My partner left me for someone else. I'm so angry and now I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. 
```

**Prompt result:**
```json
[
  {
    "title": "North by Northwest",
    "genre": "Thriller",
    "recommendation_reason": "Since you enjoy classic cinema and admire Cary Grant, but are not in the mood for romance, 'North by Northwest' is an ideal choice. Hitchcock’s masterpiece blends suspense, wit, and adventure, showcasing Grant at his most charismatic while avoiding sentimental romance. Its brisk pacing and iconic set pieces channel tension and excitement that may help you redirect your anger into pure cinematic thrill."
  },
  {
    "title": "The Night of the Hunter",
    "genre": "Film Noir",
    "recommendation_reason": "Given your current feelings of anger and uncertainty, I assumed you might connect with a darker, more unsettling classic. 'The Night of the Hunter' offers an intense, haunting narrative with striking expressionist visuals. It avoids romantic clichés and instead explores themes of betrayal and survival, which could resonate with your emotional state while also immersing you in a bold piece of classic cinema."
  },
  {
    "title": "12 Angry Men",
    "genre": "Drama",
    "recommendation_reason": "Your frustration and sense of injustice may find a cathartic outlet in '12 Angry Men.' This tightly crafted courtroom drama channels raw human conflict into gripping dialogue and moral tension. By choosing this, I’ve assumed you might find solace in watching characters wrestle with anger, prejudice, and fairness—turning personal turmoil into a collective reflection on justice and truth."
  }
]
```

### Grok evaluation:

Prompt evaluation final Score: *Outstanding*
```diff: 
• Relevance: Perfectly honors classic-cinema taste while avoiding romance; channels betrayal/anger via thrillers and moral drama.
• Reasoning: Emotionally intelligent, film-literate links (Hitchcock mastery, betrayal/survival, justice/truth) to user’s state.
• Structure: Cohesive trio of classics; minor phrasing issue (“I assumed” repetition) and slightly safe selections.
